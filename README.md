# View and ViewGroup Homework Assignment (Week 1 Day 3)
## Research Questions

1. **What are Listeners?**

Listeners are objects that have registered with an event source so that when the event source fires an event the registered event listener object will be notified. The notification usually takes place via a registered callback function that is called by the the event source and has all relevant information about the event passed to the callback in the form of a function argument.

2. **Define the difference in Runtime and Compile Time.**

Runtime and compile time refer to different stages of a program. Runtime refers to the time when the program is executing and compile time refers to when the program is built. There is also runtime binding versus compile time binding.

In runtime binding a reference isn't bound until the program is executing. For compile time binding a reference is bound at the time the program is built. Compile time binding has better performance and type checking, but is less flexible than runtime binding.

3. **What is reflection in JAVA?**

Reflection in Java is an API defined in the java.lang.reflect package. The API provides a way to access, modify, and use methods and properties for classes, methods, and interfaces at runtime. This allows an application to extend third-party classes, bypass access modifiers on properties, enumerate a class's API, etc.
